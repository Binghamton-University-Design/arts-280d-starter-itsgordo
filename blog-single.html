                            Donald Duck appeared in comedic roles in animated cartoons. Donald's first theatrical
                            appearance was in The Wise Little Hen (1934), but it was his second appearance in Orphan's
                            Benefit that same year that introduced him as a temperamental comic foil to Mickey Mouse.
                            Throughout the next two decades, Donald appeared in over 150 theatrical films, several of
                            which were recognized at the Academy Awards. In the 1930s, he typically appeared as part of
                            a comic trio with Mickey and Goofy and was given his own film series starting with Don
                            Donald (1937). These films introduced Donald's love interest and permanent girlfriend Daisy
                            Duck and often included his three nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. After the film Chips Ahoy
                            (1956), Donald appeared primarily in educational films before eventually returning to
                            theatrical animation in Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983). His last appearance in a theatrical
                            film was in Fantasia 2000 (1999). However, since then Donald has appeared in direct-to-video
                            features such as Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers (2004), television series such
                            as Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006-2016), and video games such as QuackShot (1991).

                            In addition to animation, Donald is well known worldwide for his appearances in comics.
                            Donald was most famously drawn by Al Taliaferro, Carl Barks, and Don Rosa. Barks, in
                            particular, is credited for greatly expanding the "Donald Duck universe", the world in which
                            Donald lives, and creating many additional characters such as Donald's rich uncle Scrooge
                            McDuck. Donald has been a popular character in Europe, particularly in Nordic countries
                            where his weekly magazine Donald Duck & Co was the comics publication with the highest
                            circulation from the 1950s to 2009. In Italy, Donald is a major character in many comics,
                            including a juvenile version named Paperino Paperotto, and a superhero alter ego known as
                            Paperinik (Duck Avenger in the US and Superduck in the UK).
